#  OSX Controller for testing the Smith Corona Typewriter project

This application controls the LightBlue Bean as input to the Smith Corona Typewriter project..

* The LightBlue Bean can be found here: [http://punchthrough.com/bean/](http://punchthrough.com/bean/)). 
* The libBean SDK can be found here: [https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK](https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK).

There are a couple of bugs -- 

1. Disconnecting sometimes causes an exception. I believe this has to do with some thread safety issues, but I haven't figured them out yet.
